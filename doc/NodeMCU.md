# Programming the NodeMCU

In order to program the NodeMCU you need the [CH340 driver](http://www.wemos.cc/downloads/). That will (on mac) give you the /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 port available in the Arduino IDE.

Then follow [these instructions](http://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-Start-to-Nodemcu-ESP8266-on-Arduino-IDE/) to try it using a blinking led.

Here is [pinout](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit) and other info about the NodeMCU.
